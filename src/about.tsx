                    I've been very passionate
                    about all kinds of music ever since I was little and know quite a lot about it.
                    I also produce it sometimes and play guitar.

                        &#127800;
                    </span>
                    Aside fom music, I love creation in general and there are many different forms I'd like to try, including
                    creating a visual novel or 3D modeling.
                    I am a strong advocate for self-teaching.
                    With the internet and enough willpower,
                    there are no limits.

                    I am a primarily self-taught software engineer. I pride myself on my imagination and creativity, which I hope is visible in my projects. I don't yet have any
                    experience in the field, but I love what I do and am eager to learn
                    and build some awesome things!
